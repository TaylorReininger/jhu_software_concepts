        <h2>Bio:</h2>
        <p>My name is Taylor Reininger. I'm a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at the 
            Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory with 9 years of experience
            applying AI/ML and software to some of the world's toughest problems! Prior to 
            working at the lab, I received my B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering from
            North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC, where I specialized in robotic 
            control algorithms. 
        </p>

        <p>In my spare time, I love cooking, traveling the world, and spending time
            with my rambunctious border collie puppy! I consider continuous learning a way
            of life, and have taken an additional 22 courses since getting my last degree. 
            As many will attest, the more you learn, the more you realize you don't know. 
        </p>

        <p>I'm excited to be here learning modern software concepts and building web apps. 
            I can already see a bunch of ways to use these topics in my role and in my hobbies. 
            Please feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to connect!
        </p>
