# Module 1

## Assignment


## Implementation

- I am using Python==3.12
- I am using Bootstrap for the navigation bar


## Resources

- I followed along with a lot of the course notes from the lecture
- I found the [Flask quickstart](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/quickstart/) guide very helpful for reading about the decorators and the ```__name__``` field at instantiation. 
- I found Tech with Tim had a great tutorial on [using Flask with Bootstrap and template inheritance](https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/flask/flask-adding-bootstrap) for a nav bar
