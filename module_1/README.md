# Module 1

## Assignment


## Implementation

- I am using Python==3.12


## Resources

I followed along with a lot of the course notes from the lecture

I found the [Flask quickstart](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/quickstart/) guide very helpful for reading about the decorators and the ```__name__``` field at instantiation.
