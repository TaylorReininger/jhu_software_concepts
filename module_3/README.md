## Things I've Had to Change

- Had to go back to Module 2 and make sure to also capture the link to the insticator commenting page. 
- Had to shift some of the column indexing to account for the new field in the cleaning script. 
- Had to rework the American/International portion to account for other values like "Canadian"



## Limitations

- Choosing to fill blank fields with -1 so they can still be floats


## Citations

- I found Llama3.1 extremely helpful with this homework
